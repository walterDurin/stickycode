#summary Logging Api and Logging Implementations
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

[http://www.slf4j.org/ slf4j] is the only real logging api that makes sense. The api is just a set of interfaces. It leaves the actual logging implementation up the the end user.

StickyCode defines two compositions one for anything that needs to log which essentially just pulls in slf4j-api and because jcl still seems very common it pulls in the jcl to slf4j adapter.

It is safe to use the range as if a breaking change is made the version will be bumped.
